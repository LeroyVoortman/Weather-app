# Weather app By Leroy Voortman.

This app is created to test and learn the principals of Web-Api calls with React JS.
For this project i'm gonna use the Weather-api from https://www.weatherapi.com/

# my goals for this project are:

- Make a simple web app where you can view the weather from any place you want.
- Learn how to deal with web Api's.
- Use the things i have learned about react in a actual project.
- Improve coding with React.
- Dealing better with coding from scratch.

So concluding, i want to use my knowledge about React, while simultaneously learn more about it, also learn how to deal with Api's and hopefully this will all result in a proparly working weather app.

# accomplishments

- Created an account for the Api and got the key
- Written basic code to fetch api data and display certain data.
- Base code commited to GitHub
